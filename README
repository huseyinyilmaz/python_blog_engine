#  Python Blog Engine
This is a blog engine that uses django framework. It will use markdown for style and pygments for source code coloring.
*  Blog site will have ability to serve static pages and unlimited blogs inside same site.
*  Static pages and sites might have custom admin page or if it is possible I might use standard django admin page. I did not decide yet.

This project is still in development process and does not have a stable revision yet.
